# Data Analytics / Data Science Projects
### Author: Dr. Renju Mathew.  
This is a master index for the data science and data analytics projects that are available at https://github.com/quantumphysicist/.   
There is a heavy overlap between the skills and tools used for both types of projects.


### Data Analytics
[Ford-GoBike-Trip-Data-Analysis](https://github.com/quantumphysicist/Ford-GoBike-Trip-Data-Analysis)      
- Exploratory and explanatory data analysis on a Ford GoBike ride-sharing dataset.   
- This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.  
- Demonstrates the application of data analytics for market and data-related research.  
- Results also reported as a [slideshow](https://quantumphysicist.github.io/Ford-GoBike-Trip-Data-Analysis/slideshow.html#/) containing multiple data visualizations.  

[Data analysis of an A/B test](https://github.com/quantumphysicist/Analysis_of_AB_Test_Results).      
- Analysis of the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce site.    
- A real-world application of statistics (both using simulations and analytic formulae).    

[Analysis of 10,000 movies](https://github.com/quantumphysicist/The-Movie-Database-Data-Analysis) from The Movie Database (TMDB)     
- Analysis of a dataset containing information about 10,000 movies taken from The Movie Database (TMDB).    
- Demonstrates mastery of data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization.    

[WeRateDogs tweet analysis](https://github.com/quantumphysicist/WeRateDogs-Twitter-Archive-Data-Analysis)       
- Analysis of the Twitter archive of @WeRateDogs accessed via the Twitter API.    

[Data Dashboard](https://github.com/quantumphysicist/Data-Dashboard-IBM-Data-Analyst)      
- A [data dashboard](https://www.tinyurl.com/4c9szz63) made using IBM Cognos Analytics.  
- A [report](https://github.com/quantumphysicist/Data-Dashboard-IBM-Data-Analyst/blob/main/capstone-presentation.pdf) on identifying future IT skill requirements.    

### Data Science

[Recommendations Engine](https://github.com/quantumphysicist/Recommendations-with-IBM)    
- A machine learning approach (matrix factorization), as well as rank-based filtering and user-based collaborative filtering, to creating recommendations for users.   

[Disaster Response Pipelines](https://github.com/quantumphysicist/Disaster-Response-Pipelines)  
- A machine learning pipeline that categorizes real messages sent during a disaster. 
- Built using Flask for easy deployment as a web app.   

[StackOverlow Survey Data](https://github.com/quantumphysicist/StackOverFlow-SurveyData-Analysis)  
- Data analysis on Stack Overflow survey data to help programmers understand their field.  

[Customers vs. General Population](https://github.com/quantumphysicist/Arvato)  
- Supervised and unsupervised machine learning performed on customer data.  
- Discovered properties differentiating the customer base from the population at large.  
- Created a predictive model for a targeted advertising campaign.
